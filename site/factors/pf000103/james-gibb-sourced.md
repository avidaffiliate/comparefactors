# James Gibb: The Complete Independent Review

**Risk Rating:** ORANGE  
**Last Updated:** January 23, 2026  
**Reviewed by:** Compare Factors Scotland

*This review synthesizes 94 tribunal decisions, 1,393 online reviews, company filings, and homeowner accounts.*

---

## TL;DR

- **Tribunal rate is double the sector average** (10.7 vs 5.3 cases per 10,000 properties)
- **You'll pay £900–£2,100/year**, not the £200–£280 "management fee" they quote
- **23.62% of your insurance premium** goes to the factor as commission
- **Upper Tribunal found them "deliberately or negligently misleading"** (June 2025)
- **Four senior executives left within 8 weeks** in late 2024; cash reserves dropped 99.6%
- **2.1 stars** across 1,393 reviews—communication and billing are the top complaints

**Bottom line:** Unless your building specifically needs the infrastructure of a major factor, consider alternatives.

## The 60-Second Summary

**Who they are:** One of Scotland's largest factors, managing 54,000+ homes.[^register] Founded 1872, acquired by Strathspey Capital in 2012, grown through acquisitions since.

**Tribunal record:** Elevated. 94 cases in five years, 77% upheld. The Upper Tribunal ruled in June 2025 that James Gibb provided information that was "deliberately or negligently misleading."[^kindreich]

**The fees:** Management fee (£110–£280/year) is just the start. Add insurance with 23.62% commission,[^insurance-qa] utilities, maintenance shares, and realistic annual cost is £900–£2,100+. Late payment triggers an automatic £40 penalty.[^income-recovery]

**Reviews:** 2.1 stars average (1,393 reviews across Google and Trustpilot, January 2026). Common complaints: high fees, slow responses, billing confusion. Some praise for individual property managers.

**Who it may suit:** Large new-builds needing scale and complex project capacity.

**Who should look elsewhere:** Anyone prioritising communication, transparency, or personal service.

## Company Background

James Gibb Property Management Limited (SC299465) is owned by Strathspey Capital, which has built a factoring group through acquisitions—including Life Property Management (2019, ~18,000 properties) and Speirs Gumley (2023, ~30,000 properties).[^companies-house]

**October 2024 leadership changes:** Four senior executives departed within eight weeks—CEO Douglas Weir (resigned 29 October 2024), CEO David Reid (29 October 2024), MD Nic Mayall (29 October 2024), and CFO David Lamb (30 November 2024). The company hasn't explained why.[^director-filings]

**Financial position:** The abbreviated accounts for year ending 31 March 2024 show turnover up 15% to £7.64m, but cash holdings down from £1.8m to £6,460—a 99.6% drop. Client funds are held separately under the Property Factors (Scotland) Act 2011, but the change in operating liquidity is notable.[^accounts-2024]

**Service model:** Post-acquisition, James Gibb centralised client support. Tribunal cases repeatedly cite "silos"—Finance, Income Recovery, and Client Support operating independently, sometimes at cross-purposes.[^carmichael]

## Fees & Charges

*James Gibb doesn't publish a tariff. These figures come from their Written Statement of Services, published guides, tribunal decisions, and homeowner accounts.*

### A Note on Factoring Costs

Many of the fee structures described below—float deposits, insurance commissions, late payment penalties, exit fees—are **industry-standard practices**, not unique to James Gibb. Most Scottish factors operate similarly.

What varies between factors is: the specific amounts charged, how transparently they're disclosed, and how fairly they're applied. James Gibb's tribunal record suggests issues with the latter two.

Your actual costs will also depend significantly on your building: age, number of flats, shared amenities (lifts, entry systems, landscaping), and general condition. A modern 100-unit development with lifts and concierge will cost far more to factor than a 6-flat Victorian tenement. The figures below are indicative ranges—your mileage will vary.

### The Real Cost Structure

| Cost Element | Typical Range | Notes |
|--------------|---------------|-------|
| **Management fee** | £110–£280/year | Subject to annual increases[^wss] |
| **Float deposit** | £200–£300 | One-time; refunded on sale[^float-guide] |
| **Insurance share** | £400–£840/year | Varies hugely by building; includes commission |
| **Utilities & cleaning** | £100–£200/year | Depends on shared areas |
| **Ad-hoc works** | £200–£800/year | Unpredictable |
| **Realistic total** | **£900–£2,100+/year** | Before any major works |

The headline management fee represents only **10–15% of actual annual cost**.

### Key Fee Findings

**Management fee inflation:** Tribunal case FTS/HPC/PF/23/3699 documents a **23% increase over two years**—from £28.32/quarter in 2021 to £34.85/quarter by late 2023—well above CPI.[^fee-inflation]

**Insurance commission:** James Gibb's published "Insurance Commission Q&A" confirms they receive **23.62%** of your buildings insurance premium as commission.[^insurance-qa] This is within the range common across the industry (15–25%), but on the higher end. 

In *McVitie v James Gibb* (Housing and Property Chamber, 12 November 2021), a homeowner paying £840/year (£70/month) through James Gibb's broker arrangement found 33 of 38 alternative quotes were under £252/year (£21/month). The Tribunal also noted that a James Gibb staff member incorrectly told the homeowner it was "not possible" to change insurer—later admitted as wrong.[^mcvitie]

**Late payment penalty:** James Gibb's Income Recovery Guide specifies a £40 automatic charge at Stage 2 (7 days after the first reminder).[^income-recovery] 

In *Mrs. Diane Jackson v James Gibb* (FTS/HPC/PF/22/0190), a homeowner received no communication for five years—James Gibb sent invoices to a property address she didn't live at, and when mail returned "gone away," the system continued applying penalties rather than pausing. She was eventually hit with £99 in accumulated automated fees. The Tribunal ordered a refund and found the factor's address-tracking systems inadequate.[^jackson] The issue wasn't the penalty itself—it was the automation running without proper data.

**Float refund delays:** James Gibb's Float Guide outlines a refund timeline that can mean waiting six months after sale, depending on when in the quarter you complete.[^float-guide] 

In *Mr. Alexander Carmichael v James Gibb* (FTS/HPC/PF/21/2349), a homeowner with a £34.38 credit waited **nine months** for his refund—while simultaneously receiving threatening Stage 2 debt collection letters. The Tribunal found the delay was caused by internal "silos": the Finance team had the money but claimed they didn't have bank details, while Income Recovery continued sending demands. The Tribunal awarded £250 compensation—nearly 8× the disputed amount.[^carmichael]

**Energy broker fees:** The Written Statement of Services (Issue 16, July 2024) discloses that energy brokers "may be remunerated by the supplier through a commission, or by an increase in the 'kWh rate' under the electricity contract." Homeowners are "entitled to know how much the broker earns" but must request this in writing—it's not proactively disclosed.[^wss] This practice is common industry-wide.

**Exit fees:** The Written Statement specifies a "reasonable fee" for handover administration—amount unspecified, payable in advance of document release.[^wss] Sinking fund contributions are not returned to departing owners (standard practice).[^selling-guide]

## What 94 Tribunal Cases Reveal

We matched 94 Housing and Property Chamber decisions to James Gibb between 2021 and January 2026 using case reference numbers and party names.[^methodology]

### The Numbers

| Metric | James Gibb | Sector Average |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| Cases (5 years) | 94 | — |
| Rate per 10,000 properties | **10.7** | 5.3 |
| Complaints upheld | **77%** | ~71% |
| Property Factor Enforcement Orders | 32 | — |

A factor managing 54,000 units at the national average rate (5.3 per 10,000) would expect ~29 cases. James Gibb has 94—more than triple the expected volume.

### What Homeowners Complain About

Based on our categorisation of primary complaint types across all 94 cases:

| Category | Cases | Share |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Communication failures | 25 | 27% |
| Disclosure & transparency | 21 | 22% |
| Maintenance & repairs | 13 | 14% |
| Financial management | 9 | 10% |
| Other/procedural | 26 | 28% |

### Key Decisions

**Kindreich v James Gibb (Upper Tribunal for Scotland, 2025 UT 37, June 2025):** The Upper Tribunal quashed part of the First-tier Tribunal's December 2024 decision and found James Gibb breached OSP6 (Overarching Standard of Practice 6) by providing information that was **"deliberately or negligently misleading or false."** The Tribunal also found breaches of OSP11 (response times) and Section 2.7 of the Code of Conduct (behaviour toward homeowners).[^kindreich] This "deliberately or negligently misleading" standard is a high bar—not mere administrative failure.

**FTS/HPC/PF/22/1597 (August 2022):** Edinburgh tenement with prolonged roof leak. The Tribunal found multiple Code breaches relating to communication and repairs and proposed **£2,500 compensation**—one of the larger awards against any Scottish factor.[^roof-leak]

**FTS/HPC/PF/23/2752 (January 2025):** James Gibb overcharged homeowners for communal gas supply. Ordered to refund **£1,333.43** plus **£1,000 compensation**.[^gas-overcharge]

### Historical Context

In a **Scottish Parliament housing debate on 23 May 2018** (col. 79), James Gibb was named among factors with multiple tribunal rulings:

> "James Gibb Property Management has had 17 hearings and 13 rulings against it"

Also named that day: Charles White Ltd and Apex Property Factor. Apex was subsequently **removed from the Scottish Property Factor Register**.[^parliament]

## What Homeowners Say Online

| Platform | Score | Reviews | Accessed |
|----------|-------|---------|----------|
| Google | 2.0★ | 589 | January 2026 |
| Trustpilot | 2.1★ | 804 | January 2026 |

For comparison, an average Scottish factor scores around 3.5★ on Google.

**What people praise:** Individual property managers who are responsive; capacity for major projects like cladding remediation.

**What people criticise:** High fees and unexpected bills (50%+ of negative reviews); unanswered calls and emails (40–50%); maintenance delays (30%); staff turnover (one reviewer reported "11 different property managers in 9 years").

**Notable comparison:** Speirs Gumley—acquired by Strathspey Capital in July 2023 and now under the same parent company—maintains a **4.2★ Trustpilot rating** versus James Gibb's 2.1★. This suggests either different operational approaches between the brands, or that integration has not yet affected Speirs Gumley's service model.[^trustpilot]

## Our Assessment

**Rating: ORANGE**

James Gibb's tribunal rate is double the sector average. Complaints centre on communication and transparency—the fundamentals of factoring. Reviews describe premium pricing with service concerns. The 2024 leadership exodus and financial changes suggest a company in transition.

If you're with James Gibb and experiencing unclear charges, slow responses, or maintenance delays, the data confirms your experience aligns with a broader pattern.

## Thinking of Switching?

### Check Your Deeds First
Many new-builds have a deed clause appointing the first factor. You're not stuck forever, but the deeds may outline a change procedure (typically majority vote). The Property Factors (Scotland) Act 2011 gives homeowners the right to change factor regardless of deed provisions, but the process varies.

### Questions to Ask Any Factor

These aren't just James Gibb questions—ask these when interviewing any prospective factor:

**On fees:**
- What is the exact annual management fee for our development?
- What is your insurance commission rate? (Industry range: 15–25%)
- Do you use energy brokers, and if so, how are they compensated?
- What are your late payment penalties and at what stage do they apply?
- What is your exit/handover fee?

**On service:**
- Will we have a dedicated property manager? What's their caseload?
- What are your response time commitments for emails and repairs?
- How do you handle emergency works authorisation?
- Can we see your tribunal record? (You can verify this at [our tribunal database](/tribunals) or the Housing and Property Chamber website)

**On transparency:**
- Can we see a sample invoice showing all line items?
- How do you report on building fund balances?
- What access do owners have to contractor quotes?

### Request These Documents From Your Current Factor

Before deciding to switch, request in writing:
1. Development Schedule (exact management fee)
2. Insurance certificate showing commission percentage
3. Full schedule of additional service charges
4. Energy broker arrangements and markup
5. Sales/apportionment fee

If these are refused or delayed, that tells you something about the transparency you can expect.

### The Switching Process
1. Hold owner vote (AGM/EGM)
2. Document majority agreement
3. Give required notice in writing (check your deeds—typically 4 weeks to 3 months)
4. Factors must hand over documents within 3 months under the 2011 Act
