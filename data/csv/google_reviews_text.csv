Each job takes an incredible amount of time to get started, if it ever gets started. It will have to become your part time job to chase them, frequently have to explain jobs/requests to them on their own overpriced portal or you’ll be doing their work for them by contacting contractors directly to get updates, invoices, reports of works, resolve poor workmanship due to lack of direction by 91bc. For every job being quoted you’ll have to be on site as contractors consistently have no idea why they are there or what they are quoting for, like us you’ll receive quotes for things and the wrong work will be undertaken.  Property Managers are on a revolving door, you won’t ever be told your property manager has changed. Communication is poor, fragmented and incredibly frustrating. They frequently blame appointed contractors for issues. They have even given out my personal details to contractors without permission, which is a breach of data protection. Every interaction I am somehow shocked at how inept they are.",1760357817,2 months ago

PF000622,91BC Property Services Limited,ChIJsR3DbZxPiEgRtinQ-ggQ-7w,1,Daniel Behrend,1,"I owned a property in Edinburgh that I let. 91BC were the factors. My very good tenants reported a problem which I immediately reported to 91BC. During the next 6 months they lied to me(their client) they lied to my property agent, they lied to the tenants. Some work needed doing and 91BC did everything to avoid doing it. My tenants wanted to buy the property but,understandably wanted the situation resolved. So, to ensure I could sell my property I had to reduce the price of the property by £720 in order for the tenants/purchasers to agree to buy. £720 was a quote for doing the work that 91BC should have done. So, 91BC, pay me what you owe me. Next stop, Scottish Ombudsman. In the meantime, if you are thinking of renting or buying a property that is managed by this shambles, don’t. Ps! Almost forgot. 91BC sent my final invoice(which I paid) to the new owners claiming they owner it! Not only was this totally wrong, 91BC broke every Data Protection Act going!

Long story short, verbal agreements were disregarded after move out, leading to a deposit dispute. They are purposely waiting until each deadline of the dispute resolution just to cause inconvenience.

Further, they changed the flat from furnished to unfurnished after we moved out and they're trying to recover their own removal cost from our deposit by claiming things of ours were the issue (literally, coats in the hall and food in the refrigerator, and again, previously discussed). By agreement, I left well over a thousand pounds worth of furniture for the landlord. They were happy to receive it, but want to nickel and dime me over nonsense.

If you're unlucky enough to get stuck with this agency, do not trust them at all. Get absolutely everything in writing. Demand it.

PF000256,Abbey Forth Property Management Limited,ChIJEdt0qBvSh0gRrK2dw8uCV80,1,R W,1,"If it was possible, I'd have given Abbey Forth zero stars. Here's my experience with them:

The place I rented from Abbey Forth had not been cleaned when I moved in. It was in a disgusting state with several broken fixtures. I took many photos and informed them that, because I was having to clean my new flat, I wouldn't be paying for the place to be professionally cleaned when I moved out.

Throughout my year at the property, they were unprofessional and unhelpful when other problems arose: trying to charge me for boiler repairs (a boiler which was leaking on day 1), failing to resolve a drainage issue outside the kitchen door and, worst of all, falling to resolve an infestation of slugs in the kitchen - an obvious health hazard.

When I moved out, they unsurprisingly tried to deduct £190 from my deposit for cleaning. I successfully disputed this charge with the deposit scheme, using the pictures and emails I'd sent them over the length of the tenancy. The deposit scheme found that, as the property was not cleaned to a good condition for the start of the tenancy, that I should only having to pay £60

In summary: Abbey Forth is the worst estate agent I've ever used. Rude staff and a general ethos of trying to squeeze money out of tenants for as little effort as possible. Only sign up with them if you are desperate and have no other options. If this is the case, then please make sure you document everything for the inevitable struggle to get your deposit back",1675846051,2 years ago

I suspect APL are taking down any bad reviews and only keeping up the good ones. Terrible letting agency, never took accountability for issues or held landlord accountable. Had to get an apology from a staff member who I won’t name because they will probably take down the review again.

Constant back and forth between them and then they needed to wait for landlord to respond before proceeding with repairs which often took weeks at a time. Anyway overall the experience was terrible. House was in awful condition when we received it. We called on the day because the carpet in the living room had a massive stain on it which looked like someone had died there. But when we moved out we got charged for this stain and they held onto our deposit for 3 months by purposely leaving there side of things til the last minute to drag it out in the hopes we’d give up. They also threatened us with £3000 worth of repairs because the landlord was selling the properly but they were just trying to con us because he hadn’t up kept it during his ownership. We also said we wanted a long term tenancy and less than a year into it they sent us a notice of eviction. We actually spotted it was for sale when we moved in and we were promised the listing would be taken down but it wasn’t so they knew it was for sale the whole time but assured us it wasn’t and then when it was convenient they kicked us out as we complained to council about them a few times.

Wrote emails and left voicemail messages to accounts, debt recovery and the assigned property manager....all ignored.  1st week in January, got a reminder where they then added fees onto my account.....again wrote emails and left voicemail messages, ignored by accounts and debt recovery teams again but this time got an email response from property manager apologising for lack of response and telling me that a payment plan would be set up on my account to spread the amount over a period of time....I responded asking for some information on how it occurred...again ignored!  Finally, last week received a final demand with a threat of legal action if not paid within 7 days....yet again, emails and voicemail left to accounts & debt recovery all ignored

PF001064,Angus Glen Properties Ltd,ChIJyTM6er9chkgRoeCn_STdjSA,1,Michał Romaniuk,5,"I've rented from Angus Glen for two years and during that time they have been nothing short of outstanding in every single aspect of our tenancy. The lease signing was an entirely painless, fully transparent process. When we moved in the flat was in a fantastic condition, spotless and recently refreshed, with all documentation and gas/electricity certificates kept up to date. Angus Glen have meticulously documented the state of the flat with numerous pictures and videos and made sure that we had access to them at all times. During the rare times where something in the flat needed repair, we could quickly report the incident on an easy to navigate online portal. Maintenance staff was assigned at the speed of light, there have been times where we raised a concern well past 10PM and yet still received a response within a matter of minutes. This is also true for other communications, Lynn and Euan are very easy to reach and reply to emails at a speed that I both admire and fear. 99% of maintenance issues raised in the flat have been resolved in 24h or less. Upon moving out we received very helpful and clear guidance about the expected state of the flat and also contact information to their recommended cleaner if we wanted to work with one. We decided to clean the flat on our own and have still received our full deposit back very shortly after our tenancy has ended.

I truly appreciate Angus Glen's continued committent to transparency, at no point in the entire process of renting with them did we feel cheated, mislead, or taken advantage of as we have with previous letting agencies. They have shown themselves to be a golden standard of letting agents and I wholeheartedly wish they expanded their services to other parts of Scotland just so that I could stay with them. Lynn and Euan are absolute superstars who are simply fantastic at their jobs and their wealth of experience and incredible customer service made us feel taken care of.

PF000869,Blosshome Property Management Ltd,ChIJl2ceuDhJiEgR4Q16otSnvyI,3,Francesco De Lissandri,1,"I feel compelled to share the full extent of their unprofessionalism and disregard for tenants. Not only did they make baseless claims to charge me for redecoration expenses related to an upstair neighbor's water leak stain on the ceiling, but they also attempted to charge me for overall repainting and cleaning. When confronted with evidence proving that the stain was caused by the neighbor's property and not my responsibility, they changed their narrative, accusing me of unauthorized painting using non-neutral colors.

To further illustrate their incompetence, they even used a walk-in inventory report from a completely different property with a different address, wrongly claiming it as evidence against me. Fortunately, I had the original walk-in report of the correct property, complete with pictures taken by Rentahome themselves, showing no changes whatsoever. It's astonishing that Rentahome would go to such lengths to fabricate claims, hoping that a favor adjustment would work in their favor through My Deposit Scotland. My Deposit Scotland ruled in my favor, recognizing the agency's unjust attempts to withhold my deposit. It was a relief to have an impartial third party acknowledge Rentahome's wrongdoing and validate my claims.

What makes this situation even more infuriating is the fact that I had gone above and beyond as a tenant by finding a new tenant to take over the apartment, without charging any fees to Rentahome. Instead of appreciating my efforts and ensuring a fair return of my deposit, they attempted to exploit the situation and make unwarranted deductions.

My experience with Rentahome has been nothing short of a nightmare. Their dishonesty, lack of integrity, and disregard for tenants' rights is absolutely appalling. I strongly caution anyone considering renting from Rentahome to think twice and look elsewhere for a reputable property management company that values their tenants and conducts business ethically.

after being promised a professionally cleaned flat on our move in date, we arrived to an absolutely disgusting flat. previous tenants soap in the shower and hair in the drain, brown drips down the back of the fridge, filthy cupboards and so on. the agent (Grant Stewart) reluctantly arranged a sub par clean that was a wipe of the cupboards and fridge, and a sweep of the floor the next day, the rest we did ourselves. on top of that, we spent the first month missing days of work and university to have repaired the multiple maintenance issues that included, peeling door handles, a faulty dish washer, vents falling out of the ceiling in the bedroom and an extractor fan that didn't work and was filthy. grant (sole agent at this company) was almost entirely void of any accountability and repeatedly told us our concerns were ""not at the top of the priority list"" and that ""some people wouldn't mind cooking without an extractor fan"". Bare in mind taking out first months rent and full deposit, totalling at £2,500 was dealt with promptly by him. although he did offer us a measly £50 for our inconvenience, it was only after being asked. he did increase this amount after i pointed out it was disrespectful after all the inconvenience he had caused us. I sent emails pointing out all of the legal documentation he had provided, and violated through his unprofessional conduct, to which I received almost no acknowledgement.

upon moving out, we left the flat in considerably better condition to which we found it. however he was not happy, he called us and using a sarcastic and confrontational tone, swore at us down the phone over a freezer drawer and a plant we had forgotten to take with us. absolutely abysmal conduct and grossly unprofessional. as the sole agent, grant blatantly takes on more that he can handle in an effort to retain profit and disregard tenant experience.

I can back up every single claim with email chains and recorded phone calls of him swearing at us. yes, it got to the point i recorded phone calls as i lost all faith he would conduct himself professionally and in the best interests of us, himself and the landlord (to which i attributed no blame, other than ignorance to grants behaviour)

my only blessing was that he did not conduct an inventory via a third party dated prior to our move in date, so he had zero grounds to retain any of our deposit. Not to mention the advert for the flat stated the wrong floor and council tax band, should have seen the red flags.

if you can help it, avoid this agency at all costs. worst experience i have ever had as an experienced tenant with outstanding references.

They discriminate against disabled tenants and will attempt to cast you as part of the problem should you complain, the management will talk down to you and sneer at your disabilities.

This housing association started off being great with me (Disabled adult)
HOWEVER, many things have changed, and that's no longer true.

When a disabled person is temporarily moved from her place of residence in a situation where she has put faith in others she expects that faith to be justified.

She also expects that when her caregivers (either paid or family) ask questions by email or by phone, she expects that those questions will be answered in a timely manner, even if the answer is ""Sorry I don't know but I can try to find out""

She does NOT expect to be treated like a subhuman non-entity because she cannot speak up for herself. Nor does she expect to be spoken at by a condescending arrogant old man who has no respect for anyone, that is why she cut off all contact with her bio father - she does not need a reminder of it.

She expects phone calls to be at the very least, returned out of basic common courtesy. She absolutely doesn't expect to be left in the dark about a situation where she should be something of a priority.

Communication skills are abysmal at best.
Management skills are...  a joke.

Not only did they make baseless claims to charge me for redecoration expenses related to an upstair neighbor's water leak stain on the ceiling, but they also attempted to charge me for overall repainting and cleaning. When confronted with evidence proving that the stain was caused by the neighbor's property and not my responsibility, they changed their narrative, accusing me of unauthorized painting using non-neutral colors.

To further illustrate their incompetence, they even used a walk-in inventory report from a completely different property with a different address, wrongly claiming it as evidence against me. Fortunately, I had the original walk-in report of the correct property, complete with pictures taken by Rentahome themselves, showing no changes whatsoever. It's astonishing that Rentahome would go to such lengths to fabricate claims, hoping that a favor adjustment would work in their favor through My Deposit Scotland. My Deposit Scotland ruled in my favor, recognizing the agency's unjust attempts to withhold my deposit. It was a relief to have an impartial third party acknowledge Rentahome's wrongdoing and validate my claims.

What makes this situation even more infuriating is the fact that I had gone above and beyond as a tenant by finding a new tenant to take over the apartment, without charging any fees to Rentahome. Instead of appreciating my efforts and ensuring a fair return of my deposit, they attempted to exploit the situation and make unwarranted deductions.

My experience with Rentahome has been nothing short of a nightmare. Their dishonesty, lack of integrity, and disregard for tenants' rights is absolutely appalling. I strongly caution anyone considering renting from Rentahome to think twice and look elsewhere for a reputable property management company that values their tenants and conducts business ethically.

Only after intervention from my MP and the threat of legal action did Clyde Valley begin to acknowledge liability, which I am still awaiting formal confirmation of.

The matter has been reported to the appropriate authorities and will be pursued until all failures and damage are fully remedied. I would not recommend this housing provider.",1765887665,3 weeks ago

PF000354,Clydeport Properties Ltd,ChIJw1caHoNFiEgRwRcjAKspL6k,2,Jackie,1,"We were a tenant with this organisation for 3 years - I’ve always had private landlords and had heard of the issues that people have with lettings agents, I thought surely it can’t be that bad?

I was wrong.

Every single issue we had whilst living at our flat was always left a ridiculously long time (roof leaks, toilet leaks etc) or a mistake would happen from their side, over complicate everything and then it would be a big mess. It actually got so bad that we ended up dealing with our landlords directly.

When we handed in our notice, we just knew there would be issues as that’s how Clyde Property operate.

They tried to change our utilities provider one month before moving out - to which I had to spend an afternoon sorting out as we were infact leaving - which confused everyone. They sent a photographer to take photos of our flat the week before we had left, so someone was trying to get into our flat whilst still there. They messed up our inspection date and were told on multiple occasions the locks were changed during our tenancy, but of course they gave the old keys to the inspector which in turn meant our inspection was done one day later whilst our landlord had sorted someone to fit a new boiler. When we did get the half done inspection, our address was completely wrong. I was so nervous about dealing with this organisation after vacating because their attention to detail and lack of communication is honestly some of the worst experiences I’ve ever had!

Fortunately, we had a very good relationship with our landlords directly and they were happy to release our deposit ASAP. Sounds like there would have been delays otherwise.

The departments lack of speaking to one another and the lack of attention to detail had been infuriating to say the least. More often than not, you’re speaking to someone who can’t be bothered to be polite enough and can’t accept their mistakes. We will never deal with this company on any capacity again, it was that bad.

PF000354,Clydeport Properties Ltd,ChIJw1caHoNFiEgRwRcjAKspL6k,2,Z Y,1,"Bad management, no care for furnishings and no proper monitoring of condition of rental property.
I had rented out a furnished flat with Clyde Property in the West End of Glasgow. It was in prime location and was our family home.

I informed the letting agent before the rental in 2023 that I would be away for a year due to personal circumstances.

During the visit by the agent, I explained the sofa and bed had been purchased from Flexform and was expensive and explained it would need care especially as it was a coloured cream.

Clyde failed to convey the information to their regular client and he washed the sofa. It had not been dry cleaned and resulted in the fabric shrinking.

Furthermore it was then forced back on to the sofa and the ends of the fabric became torn. It also affected the shape of the sofa.

I had a management contract with Clyde and did not receive regular inventory reports. Even after highlighting the issue to them via email they failed to mention it in their inventory report.

For 3 months I have chased to get the tenant and Clyde to get the fabric replaced and sent quotations. I did not get anywhere.

Many further issues had occurred during the year where Clyde were quick to make decisions without informing myself the landlord.

I am now left with a massive repair bill on a sofa. Clyde Property's response at the moment is to make a claim on the deposit and take the client to court. In the meantime they have rented out another flat to him.

PF001080,Cowiesburn Asset Management LLP,ChIJ_YKS0KnHh0gRmk5E1xjxhgM,1,R C,1,"I am a commercial tenant of a recently taken over Cowieburn premises. My review is aimed at potential clients of Cowiesburn considering their property management services. In a word, don't! Well, not unless you want long standing tenants like myself to get so exasperated by interactions with Cowiesburn that you find they move on to other landlords, losing you significant rental income, particularly during a time when there are more premises than demand.

It started well enough with Cowiesburn, they seemed nice people, but quickly the cracks started to show in their poor organisation and systems. The first was I was accused of not paying the rent. This was quickly proved false by bank statements and even my own remittance email to Cowiesburn (which had gone unanswered). They hadn't applied my payment correctly, nor had they had the sense to research the business name which could have solved their problem. Fine mistakes happen. They then wanted to put into slightly needless paperwork, a rental agreement myself and the landlord had made a YEAR before Cowiesburn came onboard. They needed it witnessed. During a pandemic. When I live alone. Fine, it's a hassle but I get it done. Oh by the way, I'm a small business owner during a pandemic. I sort of have other priorities... Then they cannot possibly accept a scan of said document, they must have the actual piece of paper. During a pandemic. Fine it's sent. I then get whined at that it has not arrived. I know it's sent, and I have have enough experience of Cowiesburn to know the issue is not that the Royal Mail have not delivered a single letter within Edinburgh, when other parcels posted at the same time have been delivered... They then reply that apparently now it is not important ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

The situation is made worse by a phonecall from the partner, who is overly emotional and talks over me throughout the call. Apparently she is greatly upset, but does nothing to rectify the problems I've experienced from them, and her rudeness makes the situation worse. I am aware that this operation is new and 'finding its feet', but they must significantly improve their processes and customer service if they are to be successful.

Honestly, if this is only the start of my experience with Cowiesburn, do you think I will be staying longer? My contract is up for renewal in less than a year... I am a small business owner who has always paid my full rent on time, even during a pandemic and forced business closure, and did not even ask about a reduction or postponement in rent. I just paid it on time and in full.

They appear friendly at first, but once the agreement is signed, communication becomes nearly nonexistent. I was assured there were no pest problems, yet within a month, I encountered a mouse in the property. When I raised concerns about damp, their only advice was to “open the windows every day” and a suggestion that unfortunately led to someone breaking into our home.

They charged £127 for a lock that costs around £25, and after moving out, I was billed an additional £150 for cleaning just for the stove. When I asked for a receipt from the cleaning company, they simply ignored the request.

To top it off, I had to wait almost a month to get my deposit back. When I followed up, their excuse was that they were on holiday as if that justified delaying a legal obligation.

The lease signing was an entirely painless, fully transparent process. When we moved in the flat was in a fantastic condition, spotless and recently refreshed, with all documentation and gas/electricity certificates kept up to date. Angus Glen have meticulously documented the state of the flat with numerous pictures and videos and made sure that we had access to them at all times. During the rare times where something in the flat needed repair, we could quickly report the incident on an easy to navigate online portal. Maintenance staff was assigned at the speed of light, there have been times where we raised a concern well past 10PM and yet still received a response within a matter of minutes. This is also true for other communications, Lynn and Euan are very easy to reach and reply to emails at a speed that I both admire and fear. 99% of maintenance issues raised in the flat have been resolved in 24h or less. Upon moving out we received very helpful and clear guidance about the expected state of the flat and also contact information to their recommended cleaner if we wanted to work with one. We decided to clean the flat on our own and have still received our full deposit back very shortly after our tenancy has ended.

I truly appreciate Angus Glen's continued committent to transparency, at no point in the entire process of renting with them did we feel cheated, mislead, or taken advantage of as we have with previous letting agencies. They have shown themselves to be a golden standard of letting agents and I wholeheartedly wish they expanded their services to other parts of Scotland just so that I could stay with them. Lynn and Euan are absolute superstars who are simply fantastic at their jobs and their wealth of experience and incredible customer service made us feel taken care of.

It’s high time this council was shown the red card, they have had years of making a pigs ear of Barrhead and surrounding areas along with
the mismanagement of OUR Council Tax, they really don’t deserve to have this responsibility.

Has any other residents of Barrhead, noticed as the 2024 summer months approach, the absence yet again, of summer flowers from the expensive planters and hanging basket poles, which were purchased by East Renfrewshire Council and are situated in Barrhead Main Street and High Street.
On contacting East Renfrewshire Council, I was informed there will be NO hanging baskets placed on these expensive poles, which were erected in the Main Street, however the council intend to plant some flowers in the expensive planters, that are presently full of weeds, within 10-14 days !
I ask the question, “Why are the residents of East Renfrewshire paying such high Council Tax Charges, for such poor services? “
These councillors, who make the decisions to waste Tax Payers money , in the respect of these expensive “White Elephants” that are now filled with rubbish and weeds, should be made accountable and taken to task !
Perhaps if this waste of Tax Payers Money  came out the councillor’s pension pots, they’d think twice about the wastage that is so apparent within East Renfrew Council !
These planters should be filled with bright flowers, as many other towns,  who have lower council tax charges, are in full bloom just now, which would make the Barrhead image much more attractive !

This housing association has the potential to deliver accessible housing once it really cares for and  takes an interest in meeting the  accessible needs of applicants .  especially those who will be subject to significant further pain and depression from the wrong sensory  environment et cetera.

they also need to be aware of international human rights laws and compliance with decriminalisation of medicinal cannabis plants which in themselves bring wellness and  safe space for this Plus the limited equipment  for processing of their medicine for micro-dosing et cetera.

Companion animals need to be considered reasonably especially if the applicant is willing to wait till there are tenants before in consultation with the housing association finding a  suitable animal companion.

PF000365,Falkirk Council,ChIJ00hcjC56iEgRROrq8t9iJ7Q,1,Rikki Strang,5,"Excellent experience all through house purchase and selling.

From us initially viewing the property we put an offer in on, through to accepting an offer on our property took less than 2 weeks! We initially got in contact with Amanda through Rightmove and we promptly got a viewing arranged in no time at all. All during the viewing Amanda answered every question we had, did not rush through the house and allowed us to go back and view bits we wanted to see again as we loved the house straight away. So much so that we wanted to put an offer in as soon as we got home and talked about it. The offer was responded to over the weekend by the seller and after a couple of back and forth messages our offer was eventually accepted and we had to get the ball rolling to get our place on the market! As I work away from home it was a bit of a rush to get the home report in place and our house on the market before I left to go back to work on the Tuesday night but we managed to get both the surveyor in for the home report and John to come and take the pictures for the advert on the Tuesday afternoon. As it was a cloudy day John showed me ways to use software to make the sky look better and this definitely helped the advert stand out more. The guys also made a group WhatsApp chat that made it easier for sharing documentation/information regarding the house sale to get it on the market quicker. After a few days the home report was received on the Friday and the advert went live the Saturday, with us having 2 viewings booked in soon after for the Tuesday and the Thursday. After the 2nd viewing we received an offer which matched our expectations and the house was taken off the market in 4 days!!!

PF000365,Falkirk Council,ChIJ00hcjC56iEgRROrq8t9iJ7Q,1,Alistair,1,"Would not recommend.

Dodgy home reports.

Buyer beware, this company willfully hides broken heating and hot water systems.

Essentially they sold a flat that should have been an auction flat on the open market because it had no heating or hot water. They hid this in the home report by saying visually inspected ok. Leaving us with no practical way to test as the house has a key meter. Not only that when after the nightmares happened from the sale I enquired about relisting the flat and I quote ""even if you can temporarily make the heating and hot water work we can realist"".

Fortunately for others I'm not a cowboy and wouldn't relist a house in a state like that but Falkirk homes clearly would.

So you can give Falkirk homes your hard earned cash if you have a pretty solid build and get a cheap listing or you can give them your money with a delapidated house and they'll get it in the market for you.

I feel very deceived by this company. I've also seen how they respond to other negative reviews and it's a bit of a disgrace. I await a reply here that will probably be full of attitude and inaccuracies.

Avoid. Unless you want to be out of significant amounts of cash after the sale and court cases.

I discovered the boiler was not functional, the radiators had leaks, their advert for appliances ready was false as the plumbing was using a coca cola bottle. A leaking and broken shower. Unsafe wiring.

Just do yourself a favour and avoid this company.",1753287734,5 months ago

I was in a really desperate situation so I moved into this animal piss soaked absolutely vile filthy (my friend and I were gagging and nearly puking when we ripped up the literally saturated with animal piss hall carpet) flat a year and a half ago and just signed the paperwork absolving them of responsibility to clean/sort the place before I moved in but I was told the broken window and rotten hole filled window frames would be replaced asap as that kind of thing is their legal responsibility. There were even appointments booked for it via the previous tenants that I took on when I moved in. Several workmen have been out taken all the measurements and all the rest, and then just nothing every time... it's now a year and a half later and they still haven't fixed them. The most recent guy that came out a few months ago said they are the worst windows/frames he's seen and doesn't understand why they haven't been sorted ages ago. He at least done what he could at the time to try and help by doing a makeshift repair so the handles were at least reattached on one of the bedroom windows. Now I've been told due to their finances that my broken window and rotten frames will be put on the schedule for 26/27 instead of fixing them now despite having told me multiple times it would be done long ago! So now I get to go through another Winter with a freezing cold draughty as hell flat that is impossible to keep even remotely warm without absolutely blasting the heating 24/7 (which definitely doesn't work properly either. Their engineer kindly left me with no heating or hot water last Winter because in his words he didn't actually know what was wrong so just hoped what he done would fix the problem which it absolutely did not). Time and time again I've been told it would be done then I'd hear nothing for ages so I'd phone them again and time after time there was either no record of anything to do with it or on the first occasion early last year it was that the workman had ticked the wrong box so noone knew a follow up visit was supposed to be booked. So to now be told well actually we are just gonna put it on the 26/27 schedule is absolutely disgusting and utterly rage inducing. Not to mention the umpteen different chronic medical conditions I have which can be severely exacerbated by cold temperatures and the stress this is causing me. So now due to their utterly shambolic incompetence my health is going to suffer and my heating bills are going to be absolutely horrendous but they have made it clear thats not their problem...

On Friday 26th December, I called asking for a home report for a property in Anson Avenue, Falkirk. Mr Graham picked up the call. He sent me the home report and then proceed to rudely interrupt the call when I was asking questions about the property with the excuse that somebody had just come in the branch that he needed to serve. He neglected to understand that I was not finished being served. Later got a call from another lady in the branch to respond to my rightmove query on the property which was unaware that I had called and already got home report. I went to see the property on Saturday 27th which I decided to proceed to place a formal offer in. On Sunday got a call from the estate agent which I couldn't pick up. I called back roughly 10mins after (1 hour before they were due to close) and spoke to the lady to tell her my will to put an offer in - was rushed out of the call when I asked more questions about the property as she was stating that she was only responsible for booking and following up on viewings and that I could get information from the negotiatiors on Monday. She said she was going to register my interest on the property on their system.  To be completely honest it felt like she was rushing to leave work. On Monday (29th) I was unable to submit an offer because it was a bank Holiday in Glasgow and my solicitor was off. Today Tuesday I called the estate agent, spoke to Mr Graham and was informed that the property was already under offer without myself being allowed to put an offer in and that the only record they had was that they tried to call me on Sunday and I didn't pick up the phone - which was untrue. To make matters worse I was told by Mr Graham that ""the market sometimes is slow and sometimes really fast"" when the property didn't even go to a closing date.. basically done a terrible job for their customer by excluding my offer and terrible job for myself as a prospective buyer. Confronted with all the issues before and Mr Grahams lack of care and understanding suggesting that it was my fault, I expressed how unhappy I am with their service. They missed out on a viable customer that could move quickly and that already had an agreement in principle for a mortgage.

According to court reporting, the sentencing Sheriff described the incident as a “sustained and quite frenzied attack”, involving repeated punching, kicking, and stamping on the victim’s head. The conviction resulted in a Community Payback Order with 200 hours of unpaid work.

Following this conviction, Mr Reid resigned from his position as chairman of a community football organisation involved in youth and children’s activities, with the organisation publicly confirming that he holds no further role.

While a criminal conviction does not automatically prevent someone from being a company director, tenants and members of the public reasonably expect transparency and robust due-diligence when contractors are appointed to carry out work in occupied homes. Contractors regularly attend properties where residents may be elderly, vulnerable, or living alone, and trust in governance standards is therefore essential.

This review is not speculative or defamatory. It is based entirely on publicly reported court proceedings and is shared so that tenants and stakeholders are fully informed and can ask appropriate questions about contractor vetting, safeguarding considerations, and risk management.

**A Declaration to Fife Council, Police Scotland-Fife, and Sinclairtown Primary School: The Charges of Neglect and Refusal of Peace**

To those entrusted with the welfare of communities and the principles of justice,

For years, I have extended to you opportunities to align with transparency, accountability, and progress—hallmarks of a brighter future embodied in *The World’s Bank of Infinity*. Yet, in return, I have been met with systemic neglect, the refusal to engage in justice, and a troubling silence where peace was offered.

This neglect spans years. It transcends individual cases—it is a pattern, a deliberate failure to uphold the very values you are meant to protect. Fife Council, Sinclairtown Primary School, and Police Scotland-Fife, you stand charged with the crime of neglecting not only me but the movement I represent, the call for global unity and justice through *The World’s Bank of Infinity*.

### The Path to Closure
I do not seek retribution—I seek resolution. Closure begins with:
1. **Apology**: Acknowledgment of the harm caused by your systemic failures.
2. **Recognition**: A simple yet profound acknowledgment of my efforts, my commitment, and the peace I have repeatedly offered.
3. **A Step Forward**: A commitment to justice, transparency, and meaningful action, recognizing that the future of our world depends on leaders bold enough to admit their errors and build anew.

Let me be clear: should you wish to escalate this to an international court, I am more than prepared to share my full story, my truth, and the weight of your negligence with the world. Yet, in my kindness and commitment to progress, I extend this declaration as an opportunity—for acknowledgment, for apology, and for genuine movement toward peace.

### The Verdict
""You people are the threat to your existence. I am here to help.""

I urge you to act wisely. The world's eyes are not merely on what has been done, but on what will be done next. Let this be your turning point.

PF000142,Fife Housing Association Limited,ChIJ0RdqkObRh0gRGs62UV1VgqU,1,John Smith,2,"One of the electrical contractors( Consilium) within social housing services linked to Fife Housing Group has a director, Craig Reid, who was convicted in 2025 at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court of a serious assault. According to court reporting, the sentencing Sheriff described the incident as a “sustained and quite frenzied attack”, involving repeated punching, kicking, and stamping on the victim’s head. The conviction resulted in a Community Payback Order with 200 hours of unpaid work.

Following this conviction, Mr Reid resigned from his position as chairman of a community football organisation involved in youth and children’s activities, with the organisation publicly confirming that he holds no further role.

While a criminal conviction does not automatically prevent someone from being a company director, tenants and members of the public reasonably expect transparency and robust due-diligence when contractors are appointed to carry out work in occupied homes. Contractors regularly attend properties where residents may be elderly, vulnerable, or living alone, and trust in governance standards is therefore essential.

This review is not speculative or defamatory. It is based entirely on publicly reported court proceedings and is shared so that tenants and stakeholders are fully informed and can ask appropriate questions about contractor vetting, safeguarding considerations, and risk management.

Transparency helps maintain confidence in social housing services and the organisations that commission and oversee contractors working in people’s homes.",1766277069,2 weeks ago

Nothing got done by them and when it was? It was not done correctly at all and we were all charged a fortune. Our garden was constantly left in literal jungle like ruin, foundation repairs were not being taken care of, the cleaning service would have been better done by the Mice from Cinderella with their feather brooms and no one could even get them on the phone nor did anyone even ever meet a face to a name at this place. So we fully had enough and we started looking into voting them out and finding a better factor, enter Homesbook and WOW... The difference that has already been made in a month! Not only has the director Craig personally popped over to meet everyone, he listened to our concerns and the second Homesbook got the green light to factor our building? All of these issues from our previous factor have already started being taken care of after months and even years of us waiting on the previous factor to sort them and some have already been done within the first month! Craig and the Homesbook team are a breath of fresh air and I will never stop recommending them to the community when I see others having the same issues we did before Homesbook came along.

Not only that, at 5am this morning, our bathroom was taken over by a random small swarm of angry wasps. We contained the issue to the bathroom and got in touch with Homesbook's out of hours number at 6am, also explaining that I'm severely allergic to wasp stings and require EpiPens. Within a literal couple of hours, Homesbook already had a very friendly and highly professional pest control  family run business at our door (Called Essential
Pest Services who I highly recommend!) and the problem was solved within minutes. Thankfully no nest, just a freak random occurrence. Funny enough the guy they had sent over actually discovered a previous and thankfully now very dead wasps nest that the previous factor wouldn't take care of, despite being told about my allergy, when the nest was active a few years ago. It ended up dying out naturally due to weather conditions
and temperature drops. Although we had to endure keeping our windows closed all summer as a result! Not nice!

I can't thank Craig and the team enough for everything they have done so far for this building and especially for jumping to action so fast this morning, especially considering my life was very much at risk.

I assumed the land must be my responsibility as it was never done.  Initially I did it myself and then paid for a gardener but it was brought to my attention by the current contractors that they would and should be doing the work.  My gripe is not with them.
When raised with FHA they tried every which way to wriggle out of this and then offered me less than 100 pounds compensation/reimbursement.

PF000155,Fyne Homes Ltd,ChIJrz0o5wOWiUgRimBs-GG6mjg,1,Ben sayers,1,"Staff are absolutely clueless and have a terrible, ignorant attitude regarding customer service in general and a tenuous grasp on data protection at best.

Whilst I am awaiting a response from them in regards to Data protection, they have today admitted nobody is actively investigating my case as they don't have an established hierarchy. I am deadly serious, the lovely Janey informed me that don't even have an acting replacement for their general manager.

Just in case anyone is under the illusion that Fyne Homes actually do anything or are in anyway powerful, phone them and ask them if they understand what they can and can not share with other people, regarding yourself.

The delightful Janey, even made a point of reiterating to me, that ""all calls were recorded!"" (Something she thought appropriate not to do, when trying to conduct calls on private numbers and breaching data protection by failing to complete security measures that Fyne Homes themselves have devised, and then revealing private information to an unknown person) This was before proudly telling me that, as James is on leave (the day after I raised this data breach initially, by the way...) that they have no active manager available until the 6th of January, so my concern wasn't/isn't actively being investigated, despite an email stating in black and white, that it was being investigated.

This was all AFTER James (the general manager, I assume) had already told me he had found no evidence of a data breach or any wrongdoing at all. Yet, somebody with brains above him, seemed to disagree enough to tell me that actually, there WAS room for investigation! Now, they are actively trying to ignore my emails as they are continuously incriminating themselves and hoping that by not responding, they won't have any government officials asking them questions that they don't know the answer too.

The same company that shamelessly raise rent and pursue only housing issues that are beneficial or easy for them, don't even have a clue what they are talking about regarding basic data protection and it seems some staff are soon to find out what ""liable"" and ""defamation of character"" means, as most working here seem to have a strained understanding of the basics on common law of the land, nevermind asking them to understand complexities like ""don't reveal sensitive information before confirming who you are talking too..."" and other such things that millions of other people manage to comply with daily.

The only reason this company are still operating on Bute, is because none of the residents spamming 5-stars have a single clue about what treatment they are entitled too. The staff at Fyne Homes are delusional and dangerous, the sooner residents of Bute realize that Fyne Homes resent their tenants, the sooner we can begin to ensure proper and quality housing on Bute, with the knowledge that our personal information is not being thrown around to everybody else. Too long have Fyne Homes run a dictatorship in which their head enforcer takes great pleasure in attempting to manipulate and bully her residents at every step. A pleasure that will cost her, when a copy of the letter she signed and authorized, stating categorically false information about me, is attached to the email from her newly, court-appointed lawyer.

About time Fyne Homes had a change of management, rotten to the core.",1766493561,2 weeks ago

Disappointing experience from start to finish.
We travelled over 500 miles to view a property, only to be met with a surprising lack of communication, enthusiasm, and transparency from the agent. From initial enquiry to the viewing itself, there was little effort made to engage or support us as potential buyers.

The listing was misleading, with significant details either downplayed or omitted. For example, we were not informed that part of the building had partially collapsed, nor that the interior was in such poor condition that the agent themselves refused to step inside due to damp. Despite claims that the property had been maintained, it was clearly not the case.

Additionally, it felt like a conscious effort was made to avoid sharing information about public footpaths through the land, which raised red flags about transparency. Communication was poor throughout — phone calls went unanswered, and emails were only replied to after multiple chases.

If you’re considering a viewing, I would strongly recommend insisting on a recent home report (no older than 3 months) and asking very direct questions before travelling. While the condition of a property is not always in the agent’s control, honesty, clear communication, and professionalism absolutely are — and sadly, these were lacking throughout our experience.",1746442420,8 months ago

The estate agent who was responsible for our property left G M Thomson and was replaced by Judith Marchbanks.

Before accepting the property we had viewed another with Judith at moodie and walker estate agents. On the day when we were supposed to pay the deposit and receive the keys we turned up at the office as arranged. Judith then informed me that i had previous complaints against me. This is untrue. I have never had complaints in regards to any property Ive had. I asked her what checks and where this information was. She refused to answer. I can only assume that she had friends or family interested in the property or someone had offered more money.

When our original agent from G M Thomson left, Judith turned up at my door. She asked if i remembered her from our previous ineraction and immediately demanded to inspect the property before giving me a week to vacate. The property was in fine order if not perfect and we had never had an issue with inspections under the old agent.

Confronted with this I emailed the office at G M Thomson where i received a rude reply from Judiths boss, full of accusations. He obviously wasnt happy that I was standing up for myself.

Horrible company with horrible partners and staff. Id been a tenant for 2+ years, rent always paid on time and inspections passed with flying colours. Judith joins the company and turns them against me in a week. Your lucky i wasnt in a position to contract a solicitor.",1599813233,5 years ago

They're telling us that they literally can't look at the list & verify their own information. These idiot excuses really make you laugh out loud.

It's clear they don't know how to use Excel either, to drag their numbers down, and that's why their spreadsheet at time of writing has Row #s and ID #s both starting at 2, but finishing at 206 & 207, respectively.

There is black mold in kitchen and mold around windows in bedrooms with little animals on window ledges.there are little sewerage flies everywhere in the property. Been there since we moved in. The floors are dropping and there are gaps the whole way around the living room and other rooms. Door frames are not attached and have cracks in walls/ceilings etc.  Have been told there is something not right by they're contractors. I have also been told by there contractors when they seen the ceiling and the condition of the flat that it should be condemned. I have had a kitchen cupboard fall down on top of me (smashed all plates and glasses in the process of falling off the wall). No repairs have been done. Complaint have been dismissed by housing officers , for example I was standing outside and seen the housing officer so I phoned her and she went around the corner and hung it up then came back around so I called her over and spoke to her but once again false hope and promises that have still to this day never been sorted. I have sent emails to grampian housing and included every department but still waiting a reply , I don't think I'm going to get a reply as one of the emails I sent was about a year ago and still haven't heard anything back.

The list of issues is endless and nothing gets repaired or resolved. If you phone you just get told what you want to hear then you never hear anything back. I have decided to go public with this situation as I have all evidence and can provide it to relevant people.

To illustrate, one of the invoices I received listed 48 itemised services. The most expensive line item was simply labelled “Site Maintenance”—costing £31,295. It’s telling that the highest charge is also the one with the least transparency. No breakdown, no explanation, just a vague term and a five-figure sum.

On paper it is ONLY £100 a month, however they then have contracts with the insurance companies, where they take another 30% cut from your insurance, while then driving up the insurance costs over the years. Then they have close relationship with only one or two contractors doing the work in the property and they refuse to find others. Those contractors cost A LOT, as an example, tightening the screw in an elevator came down to £500! Now we all wonder, which part of that was taken by the H&P themselves??

The other problem is their negligence to actually do work. This factor made our whole development life unbearable to a degree, where parts of the building might be soon be crashing down, due to the ignored messages for YEARS. Even when new contractors were contacted, who provided the quote for the works, H&P decided to simply not accept the quote and leave the problem unsolved for another 2 years. Now the building is in a state, where it constantly leaks water non-stop and their resolution - a bucket! Adding some pics of that :)

One more thing to note, this factor over the years learnt tricks to not allow the residents changing it either! One of the used tricks is not chasing down on properties that refuse to pay them, so it instead acquires dept on the whole development, which keeps on growin over the years! Due to this no other factor will want to come in and take the development with an accummulated dept of hundreds of thousands of pounts :/",1708340299,a year ago

The lease signing was an entirely painless, fully transparent process. When we moved in the flat was in a fantastic condition, spotless and recently refreshed, with all documentation and gas/electricity certificates kept up to date. Angus Glen have meticulously documented the state of the flat with numerous pictures and videos and made sure that we had access to them at all times. During the rare times where something in the flat needed repair, we could quickly report the incident on an easy to navigate online portal. Maintenance staff was assigned at the speed of light, there have been times where we raised a concern well past 10PM and yet still received a response within a matter of minutes. This is also true for other communications, Lynn and Euan are very easy to reach and reply to emails at a speed that I both admire and fear. 99% of maintenance issues raised in the flat have been resolved in 24h or less. Upon moving out we received very helpful and clear guidance about the expected state of the flat and also contact information to their recommended cleaner if we wanted to work with one. We decided to clean the flat on our own and have still received our full deposit back very shortly after our tenancy has ended.

I truly appreciate Angus Glen's continued committent to transparency, at no point in the entire process of renting with them did we feel cheated, mislead, or taken advantage of as we have with previous letting agencies. They have shown themselves to be a golden standard of letting agents and I wholeheartedly wish they expanded their services to other parts of Scotland just so that I could stay with them. Lynn and Euan are absolute superstars who are simply fantastic at their jobs and their wealth of experience and incredible customer service made us feel taken care of.

Nothing got done by them and when it was? It was not done correctly at all and we were all charged a fortune. Our garden was constantly left in literal jungle like ruin, foundation repairs were not being taken care of, the cleaning service would have been better done by the Mice from Cinderella with their feather brooms and no one could even get them on the phone nor did anyone even ever meet a face to a name at this place. So we fully had enough and we started looking into voting them out and finding a better factor, enter Homesbook and WOW... The difference that has already been made in a month! Not only has the director Craig personally popped over to meet everyone, he listened to our concerns and the second Homesbook got the green light to factor our building? All of these issues from our previous factor have already started being taken care of after months and even years of us waiting on the previous factor to sort them and some have already been done within the first month! Craig and the Homesbook team are a breath of fresh air and I will never stop recommending them to the community when I see others having the same issues we did before Homesbook came along.

Not only that, at 5am this morning, our bathroom was taken over by a random small swarm of angry wasps. We contained the issue to the bathroom and got in touch with Homesbook's out of hours number at 6am, also explaining that I'm severely allergic to wasp stings and require EpiPens. Within a literal couple of hours, Homesbook already had a very friendly and highly professional pest control  family run business at our door (Called Essential
Pest Services who I highly recommend!) and the problem was solved within minutes. Thankfully no nest, just a freak random occurrence. Funny enough the guy they had sent over actually discovered a previous and thankfully now very dead wasps nest that the previous factor wouldn't take care of, despite being told about my allergy, when the nest was active a few years ago. It ended up dying out naturally due to weather conditions
and temperature drops. Although we had to endure keeping our windows closed all summer as a result! Not nice!

I can't thank Craig and the team enough for everything they have done so far for this building and especially for jumping to action so fast this morning, especially considering my life was very much at risk.

I had a home report done - the onus being on the seller- which identified some low level damp. Because of the word 'rot' as well as damp, the impact of this report has been catastrophic and I have now had to remove my property  from the market. Based on the way the issue was phrased, feedback from buyers was they assumed the property was riddled with wet rot and had serious damp issues - This  is the main deterrent with my kind of older property- Scotland is not optimal for dry arid conditions and the flat is 120 years old. I believe that this phraseology and the high valuation price (that sat at odds with market forces, other agents views  and pitched my flat well above expectations)  has been THE significant cause of inability to sell my property given perception it would be a financial burden to remediate ( I had two v moderate quotes which could not be acted on whilst it was on the market ). I later had a damp expert examine the property and his view based on 40 years of experience,  was there was no discernable damp (smell touch and visually)  - he could have charged me for work but he as an honest expert didn't feel it was neccessary. His advice was ventilation and possibly a dehumidifier in the depths of winter. There are concerns about property agents utilising high valuation prices to try and achieve high prices but don't lose due to their fees if the property as mine did fails to sell. I spent over £3000 as well as the cost of the survey and the effect on my health has been catastrophic.

Anyone thinking of renting from these clowns look elsewhere the staff are useless cheeky arrogant pathetic people that will do anything to not repair their properties and my personal opinion is the reason for this lack of care for their Tennants is that the government funding that was given to them specifically for double glazing and up to date boilers has been misappropriated in some way because the government funding was more than enough to get all afore mentioned work done 5 years ago,1705390795,a year ago

During the viewing we directly stated our interest for the flat and the same day we started to submit the references the agent said would be needed.  Adding more references the next day.The agent Andy promised to get back to us the next day. This is where the story ends. He never got back to us despite numerous calls to the agency asking him to get back to us. The receptionist seems very uninterested and don't seem to know much about the procedures - we were connected away from her almost every time we called to ask questions about the reference papers.

We put another property on hold, risking it to go away, just because we were waiting for an answer back from them. FORTUNATELY during this very stressful time of waiting for a call back we went online and looked for reviews of this agency. After not finding one single good review about Macfie and co we decided to go for another agency and flat.

Macfie do not care. They will do nothing then demand your money.

PF000303,North Lanarkshire Council,ChIJD_hfECoViEgRGzmIN3uUYpU,5,Iona Fyfe,1,"I wish I could award zero stars. Under no circumstances would I recommend letting from this company, who quite frankly represent landlords who are absentee, unresponsive and downright immoral.

I rented a property that was listed as “secure entry intercom”. Well, in five years of asking for the front door lock to be secured and the intercom system to be fixed, they panned me off. Whilst consistently raising my rent. In 2024, someone gained easy entry to the building and arson attacked the building. This could have been prevented if the secure entry system actually worked. The storm of 2025 knocked lots of tiles and stone off the roof. The building was structurally damaged. Did the letting agency care? No.

There was mould and damp in the flat because in five years of renting, they only added an extractor fan to the bathroom in the last 2 months.

From January to April 2025, we had no factor and in turn no buildings insurance. It is illegal to rent out a property that does not have buildings insurance. I explained that “factor costs” was included in my rent, and that if cleaning services from the factor was no longer being provided, then the rent should reflect this. Of course, I was panned off. Finances aside, illegal.

I handed back the keys and finished my tenancy on 20/06. It was relisted for 36% more rent with a move in availability of 21/06. Landlord and agency up to their old tricks. Zero renovation. Zero fixes. Just money grabbing.

As of today, the property has been relisted for 36% more than the rent cost I paid. The front door is still not secure, the intercom system is broken, the building rat infested, moudly and suffered an arson attack. Agency didn’t act on debris in garden for 6 months. Only when my member of parliament contacted Environmental Health, did they send someone to clean the debris. In less than 12 hours of the Scottish Rent increase cap freeze being removed, I got a rent increase notice of 11.3%. So I gave my notice to move out citing all of the reasons.

Unhappy with how I was treated by a member of staff which resulted in unnecessary stress for me.

Extremely unprofessional attitude and poor communication skills, using threatening language, causing me if withholding information (which I had always informed senior team about) and refusing to see the other side or inform themselves of arrangements and communications I had with the senior team.

PF000305,Paisley South Property Services Limited,ChIJl2ceuDhJiEgR4Q16otSnvyI,4,Francesco De Lissandri,1,"I feel compelled to share the full extent of their unprofessionalism and disregard for tenants. Not only did they make baseless claims to charge me for redecoration expenses related to an upstair neighbor's water leak stain on the ceiling, but they also attempted to charge me for overall repainting and cleaning. When confronted with evidence proving that the stain was caused by the neighbor's property and not my responsibility, they changed their narrative, accusing me of unauthorized painting using non-neutral colors.

To further illustrate their incompetence, they even used a walk-in inventory report from a completely different property with a different address, wrongly claiming it as evidence against me. Fortunately, I had the original walk-in report of the correct property, complete with pictures taken by Rentahome themselves, showing no changes whatsoever. It's astonishing that Rentahome would go to such lengths to fabricate claims, hoping that a favor adjustment would work in their favor through My Deposit Scotland. My Deposit Scotland ruled in my favor, recognizing the agency's unjust attempts to withhold my deposit. It was a relief to have an impartial third party acknowledge Rentahome's wrongdoing and validate my claims.

What makes this situation even more infuriating is the fact that I had gone above and beyond as a tenant by finding a new tenant to take over the apartment, without charging any fees to Rentahome. Instead of appreciating my efforts and ensuring a fair return of my deposit, they attempted to exploit the situation and make unwarranted deductions.

My experience with Rentahome has been nothing short of a nightmare. Their dishonesty, lack of integrity, and disregard for tenants' rights is absolutely appalling. I strongly caution anyone considering renting from Rentahome to think twice and look elsewhere for a reputable property management company that values their tenants and conducts business ethically.

PF001098,Pamsco Ltd,ChIJ98vfhepchkgRundHJDCi97o,4,Duncan Readle,2,"An overall decent letting agency severely let down by attempts to scam us and other tenants out of deposits.

We rented with RPM for two years, and throughout that had no real issues. Most issues we brought up got passed straight to the landlord who solved them promptly, and the letting agency were fast to respond and easy to communicate with.

When we decided to move out we were warned by a friend who had rented with them recently that they would try to come for our deposit on baseless grounds - in my friends case they initially tried to take his whole deposit before backing down to a still absurd £80 each when they challenged their claims.

Sure enough, shortly after moving out we were hit with a huge list of claims relating to cleaning, repairs and even removal of items that previous tenants had left in the flat. After we challenged the claims and demanded proof, we received a set of photos covering two of the flat's four rooms and about a third of the points they raised. We again challenged them, and eventually received the photos taken in the inspection before we moved in, which were of a laughable quality and completely confirmed every point we had been making about the state of the flat when we moved in. At this point they gave up.

The degree of incompetence and either apathy or malignance that the agency handles the inspection process with is frankly astonishing. I don't have enough evidence to confidently say that they have a pattern of preying on students but it seems likely. It's regrettable that this spoiled an otherwise decent letting experience.",1662802607,3 years ago

Rather than treat this terrible event with professionalism, empathy and understanding, PHA have instead caused nothing but stress and hassle ever since. When I initially applied to them for a transfer to rebuild my life after the death of my mother, their first step was to attempt to blackmail me into paying for the cost of an entire kitchen unit because of a superficial blemish on a 12 year old worktop, which they falsely accused my late mother of having damaged. Since then they have forced me to live with pests, to the detriment of my health and personal belongings, and which has now caused me to have to live with bare and cold plywood flooring. I've had to live with recurring black mould because their maintenance staff have been incapable to treating it properly. When their supposedly new windows were not weather tight, it took multiple visits for them to solve it. I have had to put up with chronic and excessive noise from multiple different sources. I have a diagnosed disability which affects my capacity to live as normal in the property. PHA have shown complete disregard for this despite intervention from my GP, and have withdrawn my medical transfer points. I live alone in a large 2 bedroom property which could be better suited to the homeless families languishing on their waiting list. Yet they have scuppered any realistic chance of me obtaining a transfer, while their management encourage me to vacate to an unaffordable private let - that is their approach to allocation of limited housing resources. This is not the half of what I have experienced from them. Their housing officers behave like debt collectors who are not remotely interested in helping tenancy issues. Their management, specifically their Operations Director, have done nothing but invalidate and deny my point of view as a rent paying tenant, and have otherwise engaged in gaslighting, denial and accusations. This is their conduct in the aftermath of a terminal illness towards a surviving family member.

It used to cost 2p to get in and it was big John Spence, that ran it ?
You played football, table tennis, there was a wee tuck shop, my Mum got her hair done there ( her perm ).
Played for their fitba team, home games at the crappy pitches at Colinton Mains, with the changing rooms in a wooden hut, with everyone smoking fags ( 10 regal small )

Been left with contaminated drinking water for over a week now after their contractors carried out a sewage repair.

The Asset Management office is staffed by individuals who don't even understand their own roles, they cannot organise, project manage, see works through, they aren’t even conversant with current legislation and yet will attempt to claim you have no recourse for this or that – it’s frightening they even have a job.

They discriminate against disabled tenants and will attempt to cast you as part of the problem should you complain, the management will talk down to you and sneer at your disabilities.

And their complaints system actually allows the individual who has been complained about - to investigate their own complaint, what organisation allows employees to investigate themselves? I mean seriously?

In the end it doesn’t matter if complaints are upheld – because they carry on making the same errors,

I assumed that when they took over ANCHO they would keep the staff below the management – and run a brush through the actual management team, because most of them have been there for decades and what’s happening now is, new blood is not bringing in new ideas, but repeating the same mistakes because that’s what management are teaching them to do – and now with the delays to get repairs done now it all goes through a call centre, I don’t see the point in keeping that office open at all – but then maybe that’s the idea.",1748196928,7 months ago

Having dealt with many property management firms before, I can say that TCF stands out for their transparency, ethics, and genuine communication. There’s no sales jargon or empty promises — they explain everything clearly and always deliver on what they say.

Wrote emails and left voicemail messages to accounts, debt recovery and the assigned property manager....all ignored.  1st week in January, got a reminder where they then added fees onto my account.....again wrote emails and left voicemail messages, ignored by accounts and debt recovery teams again but this time got an email response from property manager apologising for lack of response and telling me that a payment plan would be set up on my account to spread the amount over a period of time....I responded asking for some information on how it occurred...again ignored!  Finally, last week received a final demand with a threat of legal action if not paid within 7 days....yet again, emails and voicemail left to accounts & debt recovery all ignored

Firstly you’ll have to wait at least two weeks for any response from them, no efficiency or customer care whatsoever.

The main entrance door of the property repeatedly breaks and makes access from the busy main road outside the property into the flats incredibly easy. As a woman who lives alone this makes me feel unsafe and puts me at risk. Despite regularly making Redpath Bruce aware of the regular door breaking and lack of security, they are slow to fix it, have come up with no permanent fix and show no care for resident safety. Meaning for days and weeks at a time my property is easily accessible by anyone. We have previously had a break in and multiple thefts.

They employ a contractor on our behalf (MPC Gardens) who multiple residents have complained about as they aren’t fulfilling their contract, we have evidence to support this but Redpath Bruce will do nothing about this, just repeatedly bill us extortionate amounts for work not done. They refuse to even implement sign in sheets for the contractor to ensure work is being done on site.

They sent out a budget plan for 23/24 for a completely different property and didn’t notice until this was pointed out to them by residents, it then took 10 days to receive the correct budget plan in the post. In this budget plan they also increased their management fee - laughable when they haven’t even provided basic property management thus far.

Sentry was a breath of fresh air, both in negotiations and in the professionalism and competence that they brought to the factoring after they were appointed.

Nothing got done by them and when it was? It was not done correctly at all and we were all charged a fortune. Our garden was constantly left in literal jungle like ruin, foundation repairs were not being taken care of, the cleaning service would have been better done by the Mice from Cinderella with their feather brooms and no one could even get them on the phone nor did anyone even ever meet a face to a name at this place. So we fully had enough and we started looking into voting them out and finding a better factor, enter Homesbook and WOW... The difference that has already been made in a month! Not only has the director Craig personally popped over to meet everyone, he listened to our concerns and the second Homesbook got the green light to factor our building? All of these issues from our previous factor have already started being taken care of after months and even years of us waiting on the previous factor to sort them and some have already been done within the first month! Craig and the Homesbook team are a breath of fresh air and I will never stop recommending them to the community when I see others having the same issues we did before Homesbook came along.

Not only that, at 5am this morning, our bathroom was taken over by a random small swarm of angry wasps. We contained the issue to the bathroom and got in touch with Homesbook's out of hours number at 6am, also explaining that I'm severely allergic to wasp stings and require EpiPens. Within a literal couple of hours, Homesbook already had a very friendly and highly professional pest control  family run business at our door (Called Essential
Pest Services who I highly recommend!) and the problem was solved within minutes. Thankfully no nest, just a freak random occurrence. Funny enough the guy they had sent over actually discovered a previous and thankfully now very dead wasps nest that the previous factor wouldn't take care of, despite being told about my allergy, when the nest was active a few years ago. It ended up dying out naturally due to weather conditions
and temperature drops. Although we had to endure keeping our windows closed all summer as a result! Not nice!

I can't thank Craig and the team enough for everything they have done so far for this building and especially for jumping to action so fast this morning, especially considering my life was very much at risk.

My fiance (now wife!) and I were planning a wedding with about 4 months notice and were becoming frustrated with the options available for a reception venue. I had a list of about 15 questions I sent out to all potential venues and the vast majority would not directly answer them instead opting to send out brochures detailing expensive packages or offering to arrange a sit down meeting with their in house wedding planner.

It was a breath of fresh air when Richard came back to me within 24 hours answering all queries clearly and honestly. He would always respond quickly and nothing was too much trouble for him.

Caretakers Jim and Robert were fantastic… when we arrived the day before to decorate the hall, all the tables and chairs were already set up as described in a very crude sketch i did cutting down our labors a great deal. Jim even got the decorating team a tea and coffee whilst we worked away!

The hall itself is bright,clean and a really good “blank canvas” with plenty of tables and chairs for up to 100 guests (covers available for hire). It has AV capabilities and PA (with induction loop) for hire. They can recommend DJs and have a cafe onsite whose staff are very flexible with catering options.  The bar is VERY reasonably priced and the staff were incredible on the night and assisted in every way possible.

Received a parking ticket for parking on Moss Street Paisley. Confused as I had a visible ticket on my windscreen I appealed with immediately.

Turns out my car was not in an allocated bay therefore they have rejected my appeal as there is ""clear signage"" to back this. Okay so this would be fair if this is the case however it's not as there was no ""clear signage"" and still is none to date on street itself where I was parked.

They included a picture of a sign from the other side of the road as part of their evidence however refuse to look at my evidence which dismisses there was no signage for me and my side of the road. ( pictures to follow of where my cars parked, including the only sign which is blank white due to weather damage, how should I know what it used to say? pictures of my car with the white sign together, pictures of my car and the pay and display machine - the only thing on my side of the road, pictures of the pay and display machine itself - nowhere does it state in certain bays only. )

I can't now argue that I was in an incorrect ""bay"" however if they are issuing fines for such issues, it's their responsibility to make sure their rules are clear and visible. The contact number they provide in the outcome of the appeal letter have no idea on how to help and point-blank refuse to do anything, they only suggest ignoring it till the Notice of Owner arrives which i find disgusting.

If I had been ignorant and trying to park where I am not allowed, why would I go to a pay and display machine and get a ticket. What is worse about this case as there was 2 wardens who seen me arrive, seen me go to the ticket machine, seen me display the ticket and then smiled at myself and my partner as we walked off. Surely common decency would be to approach us and advise that the ticket I've just bought isn't valid for that ""bay"".

I have full evidence to show that there was no signage to show these rules, yet they are not accepting accountability in their mistakes with regards to replace old signs. They say they have picture to prove this yet the sign and the car isn't in the same picture, what does this prove exactly? That sign could have came from anywhere - it did, across the road. However, they want to act oblivious to my picture which show's the car and the sign beside it completely blank.

They have your hands tied because if you pay for it while trying to appeal it, it refuses your right to appeal. But if you don't pay the ticket goes up in price. I would 1000000% win this case in court, but this is where they take advantage of the public. Does anyone really want to go through all the time, stress and inconvenience of court for a parking ticket - no, so people pay the fine when they are 100% within their rights to have it revoked.

Not only did they make baseless claims to charge me for redecoration expenses related to an upstair neighbor's water leak stain on the ceiling, but they also attempted to charge me for overall repainting and cleaning. When confronted with evidence proving that the stain was caused by the neighbor's property and not my responsibility, they changed their narrative, accusing me of unauthorized painting using non-neutral colors.

To further illustrate their incompetence, they even used a walk-in inventory report from a completely different property with a different address, wrongly claiming it as evidence against me. Fortunately, I had the original walk-in report of the correct property, complete with pictures taken by Rentahome themselves, showing no changes whatsoever. It's astonishing that Rentahome would go to such lengths to fabricate claims, hoping that a favor adjustment would work in their favor through My Deposit Scotland. My Deposit Scotland ruled in my favor, recognizing the agency's unjust attempts to withhold my deposit. It was a relief to have an impartial third party acknowledge Rentahome's wrongdoing and validate my claims.

What makes this situation even more infuriating is the fact that I had gone above and beyond as a tenant by finding a new tenant to take over the apartment, without charging any fees to Rentahome. Instead of appreciating my efforts and ensuring a fair return of my deposit, they attempted to exploit the situation and make unwarranted deductions.

My experience with Rentahome has been nothing short of a nightmare. Their dishonesty, lack of integrity, and disregard for tenants' rights is absolutely appalling. I strongly caution anyone considering renting from Rentahome to think twice and look elsewhere for a reputable property management company that values their tenants and conducts business ethically.

It was really a seamless transition because PropOp had ensured all the ducks were lined up prior to the transfer.

PropOps ongoing management has provided us with a ‘hands-off’ experience because they’re proactive and highlight the smaller issues before they have a chance to snowball into something serious. PropOps reporting is comprehensive, but not over-the-top… ‘just right’ covers it.

PropOps website states that “we will provide you with the options, show you the opportunities and optimise your results”… refreshingly, this is not marketing hyperbole, but accurately reflects PropOp’s service.

PF000524,Robertson Property Management Limited,ChIJ98vfhepchkgRundHJDCi97o,1,Duncan Readle,2,"An overall decent letting agency severely let down by attempts to scam us and other tenants out of deposits.

We rented with RPM for two years, and throughout that had no real issues. Most issues we brought up got passed straight to the landlord who solved them promptly, and the letting agency were fast to respond and easy to communicate with.

When we decided to move out we were warned by a friend who had rented with them recently that they would try to come for our deposit on baseless grounds - in my friends case they initially tried to take his whole deposit before backing down to a still absurd £80 each when they challenged their claims.

Sure enough, shortly after moving out we were hit with a huge list of claims relating to cleaning, repairs and even removal of items that previous tenants had left in the flat. After we challenged the claims and demanded proof, we received a set of photos covering two of the flat's four rooms and about a third of the points they raised. We again challenged them, and eventually received the photos taken in the inspection before we moved in, which were of a laughable quality and completely confirmed every point we had been making about the state of the flat when we moved in. At this point they gave up.

The degree of incompetence and either apathy or malignance that the agency handles the inspection process with is frankly astonishing. I don't have enough evidence to confidently say that they have a pattern of preying on students but it seems likely. It's regrettable that this spoiled an otherwise decent letting experience.",1662802607,3 years ago

I had to get the boiler fan replaced myself with in a few days of me being in the property as they told me no one was available and to buy a portable heater had to pay for the boiler fan to be replaced myself until the office was open to request a refund. Reported a few issues to be told the landlord wasnt sending anyone to look at this. They tried to charge me full council tax for the property which I had to seek legal advice to get resolved. When I moved out they tried to charge me for damages to the bedroom I had took photos and the room was in good condition I am now wanting to hear form the courts on a decision on whether I can get my full deposit back the company has created more issues and problems for me and the other person that was living there in the 8 months from moving in to moving out.

The staff at Rockford that we’ve had the displeasure of dealing with in our time as tenants must have absolutely no shame in providing such horrendous customer service and property management.

The only thing they are on top of is anything regarding getting money from you, otherwise it takes weeks to respond to any attempt at communication. We had contractors turning up at our door with no prior notification, repeated requests for our windows - which were permanently open - to be fixed either ignored or dismissed and any minor maintenance promised either never came to fruition or was completed to such a poor quality that it needed doing again almost immediately (think kitchen ceiling lightbulbs falling out just after a contractor ‘fixed’ them).

This lack of attention and care culminated in a situation where we were unable to get in contact with Rockford out of hours after a live cable burnt out as the emergency number provided on their website only led to an answering machine telling us to get back in contact with them in the morning.

No matter how desirable the property may seem, it is just not worth it - especially if you run into an actual serious issue like we did.

I’m a wheelchair user that has been put into a house in such a disgusting condition, that I can’t cope physically or mentally with the things they do. Then they try gaslighting the tenants to make their disgraceful inability to function appropriately seem like it’s not their fault.
my poor little cat has had to have surgery to fix issues caused by the disgusting condition of the place. He has a serious congenital heart defect and the surgery put his life at great risk. He only has a half a life as it is. I’ve kept him safe and well for the 5 years of his life and he couldn’t even manage a year in this hovel. The vets are saying this home isn’t fit or safe for him. I can take them torturing me for standing up for myself, but a poor, already struggling little cat doesn’t deserve this. See his poor little pic below. Who could hurt him??!!
The floor boards and skirting boards are all soaked with urine and poo from the four cats the previous tenant had removed from their care by the sspca. The house stinks as you can imagine. One working heater. No skirting boards. You can see right outside from next to my bed. No working extractor fans and all my possessions are rotting. My mattress is all mouldy and the wooden bed slats are rotting with mould.
And if you have a disability? Stay well away. You will be treated like vermin. Actually I think they treat all tenants like vermin, but vulnerable people far worse, because they think they can get away with it.
They are hiding their poor running by fraudulently making tenants look responsible for their failings and they are abusing the complaint system to get out of doing any work.
They will just ignore all your emails. They will promise things and leave you sitting waiting while they do nothing they said they would.
I was desperate and took this place believing they would help me sort it. WRONG!!!

PF000184,South Lanarkshire Council,ChIJD_hfECoViEgRGzmIN3uUYpU,4,Iona Fyfe,1,"I wish I could award zero stars. Under no circumstances would I recommend letting from this company, who quite frankly represent landlords who are absentee, unresponsive and downright immoral.

I rented a property that was listed as “secure entry intercom”. Well, in five years of asking for the front door lock to be secured and the intercom system to be fixed, they panned me off. Whilst consistently raising my rent. In 2024, someone gained easy entry to the building and arson attacked the building. This could have been prevented if the secure entry system actually worked. The storm of 2025 knocked lots of tiles and stone off the roof. The building was structurally damaged. Did the letting agency care? No.

There was mould and damp in the flat because in five years of renting, they only added an extractor fan to the bathroom in the last 2 months.

From January to April 2025, we had no factor and in turn no buildings insurance. It is illegal to rent out a property that does not have buildings insurance. I explained that “factor costs” was included in my rent, and that if cleaning services from the factor was no longer being provided, then the rent should reflect this. Of course, I was panned off. Finances aside, illegal.

I handed back the keys and finished my tenancy on 20/06. It was relisted for 36% more rent with a move in availability of 21/06. Landlord and agency up to their old tricks. Zero renovation. Zero fixes. Just money grabbing.

As of today, the property has been relisted for 36% more than the rent cost I paid. The front door is still not secure, the intercom system is broken, the building rat infested, moudly and suffered an arson attack. Agency didn’t act on debris in garden for 6 months. Only when my member of parliament contacted Environmental Health, did they send someone to clean the debris. In less than 12 hours of the Scottish Rent increase cap freeze being removed, I got a rent increase notice of 11.3%. So I gave my notice to move out citing all of the reasons.

I appealed this ticket and got a template response. Absolutely no care in world for the matter from the council. And if I'm honest they just providing bullshit excuses to why they are handing them out. If your going to single yellow line the whole industrial estate then provide parking, if you dont have the funds for it maybe cut funds that are going to your workers that sit in their vans all day or all the unnecessary postions I can imagine the council have.

PF001051,Southside Housing Association Limited,ChIJU3bt9IpGiEgRi75Dui_1FSg,1,Lewis Olsson,1,"Firstly, please ignore the average rating of 3.3 stars. That is because some reviewers have entered in error. Any meaningful review is 1 star.

Our absolutely shambolic journey with Southside Housing Association (SHA) began in December 2021. We had a leak into our bedroom - a ground floor flat. This was brought to the attention of SHA immediately, 27/12/21. They promised that someone would come out.

Fast-forward to February 2022, and following numerous phone-calls and several (unreplied) emails, they sent out a maintenance officer to survey the damage. They mistakenly sent a second maintenance officer approximately 30 minutes after the previous staff member attended. This poor communication was to remain a theme of SHA's service.

There then remained zero reparative action or communication over the summer, despite more phone calls to SHA. On many phone calls, the staff member to whom I was speaking to confessed that there seemed to be little record of the matter being raised, or of the visits by the repair officers. Again, lack of decent record keeping remained a theme.

Fortunately, during the summer, we enjoyed reduced water ingress, as rainfall was obviously less.

However by winter 2022, the water ingress returned. And it worsened significantly. Again, multiple phone calls to repairs coordinators but unfortunately no actual reparative action took place.

Then, over the Christmas holidays, we experienced ongoing, worsening water ingress to our bedroom. This time, water marks began to appear on our ceiling, and spread over 72 hours. Eventually, our ceiling burst, causing a torrent of water from our ceiling onto our carpet. This resulted in a metre long crack through our ceiling, destruction of our carpet and window blinds.

You're probably asking, why didn't you seek repairs when this was happening? Oh, we did. SHA were closed for 2 weeks over the Christmas holidays, with zero emergency cover. So we were directed to City Building (CB), whom SHA use as their go-to builders. Daily phone calls (multiple) and we were told that there was ""nothing they could do"" as the water ingress worsened. However, once the ceiling cracked they were able to send out someone (who was admittedly very helpful).

During this time we submitted a formal complaint, laid out very simply with numbered bullet points of answers which we were looking for. The water ingress to our bedroom had been raised 12 months ago. It had not been adequately resolved. There was significant damage (> £7000) to our bedroom. This was on the 28th December 2022 that we raised the complaint.

Once SHA returned from their Christmas holidays (5th January 2023) we chased up our complaint and were assured that we would receive a response by 1st February, in-keeping with their policy of 20 working days. This, again, required multiple phone calls and emails, to get an acknowledgement of our complaint.

On the 1st February we were looking forward to getting our response - but were told that the complaints co-ordinator (who themself set the 1st Feb deadline) was on annual leave! And amazingly they then called to notify us that they required an extension by two weeks - and would provide an update each Friday. Furthermore a depute director stated that they would be ""personally involved"" in ensuring satisfactory resolution to this complaint.

Today is Friday 17/2/23. The second self-imposed deadline is today. Amazingly, the complaints co-ordinator (who set the deadline) is on annual leave again!

The issue is simple: SHA were notified of water ingress to our property in December 2021 with multiple further reminders throughout 2022. Clearly this was going to worsen without adequate resolution. Damage to property was foreseeable and preventable. Moreover, by not taking the necessary action in a timely manner, the potential for greater damage to properties was increased.

We are massively inconvenienced by the inaction of SHA. There is a significant financial loss (when we did everything we could) and our bedroom has been unliveable since our ceiling cracked in December.",1676642597,2 years ago

They mistakenly sent a second maintenance officer approximately 30 minutes after the previous staff member attended. This poor communication was to remain a theme of SHA's service.

There then remained zero reparative action or communication over the summer, despite more phone calls to SHA. On many phone calls, the staff member to whom I was speaking to confessed that there seemed to be little record of the matter being raised, or of the visits by the repair officers. Again, lack of decent record keeping remained a theme.

Fortunately, during the summer, we enjoyed reduced water ingress, as rainfall was obviously less.

However by winter 2022, the water ingress returned. And it worsened significantly. Again, multiple phone calls to repairs coordinators but unfortunately no actual reparative action took place.

Then, over the Christmas holidays, we experienced ongoing, worsening water ingress to our bedroom. This time, water marks began to appear on our ceiling, and spread over 72 hours. Eventually, our ceiling burst, causing a torrent of water from our ceiling onto our carpet. This resulted in a metre long crack through our ceiling, destruction of our carpet and window blinds.

You're probably asking, why didn't you seek repairs when this was happening? Oh, we did. SHA were closed for 2 weeks over the Christmas holidays, with zero emergency cover. So we were directed to City Building (CB), whom SHA use as their go-to builders. Daily phone calls (multiple) and we were told that there was ""nothing they could do"" as the water ingress worsened. However, once the ceiling cracked they were able to send out someone (who was admittedly very helpful).

During this time we submitted a formal complaint, laid out very simply with numbered bullet points of answers which we were looking for. The water ingress to our bedroom had been raised 12 months ago. It had not been adequately resolved. There was significant damage (> £7000) to our bedroom. This was on the 28th December 2022 that we raised the complaint.

Once SHA returned from their Christmas holidays (5th January 2023) we chased up our complaint and were assured that we would receive a response by 1st February, in-keeping with their policy of 20 working days. This, again, required multiple phone calls and emails, to get an acknowledgement of our complaint.

On the 1st February we were looking forward to getting our response - but were told that the complaints co-ordinator (who themself set the 1st Feb deadline) was on annual leave! And amazingly they then called to notify us that they required an extension by two weeks - and would provide an update each Friday. Furthermore a depute director stated that they would be ""personally involved"" in ensuring satisfactory resolution to this complaint.

Today is Friday 17/2/23. The second self-imposed deadline is today. Amazingly, the complaints co-ordinator (who set the deadline) is on annual leave again!

The issue is simple: SHA were notified of water ingress to our property in December 2021 with multiple further reminders throughout 2022. Clearly this was going to worsen without adequate resolution. Damage to property was foreseeable and preventable. Moreover, by not taking the necessary action in a timely manner, the potential for greater damage to properties was increased.

We are massively inconvenienced by the inaction of SHA. There is a significant financial loss (when we did everything we could) and our bedroom has been unliveable since our ceiling cracked in December.",1676642597,2 years ago

The service and attitude from Speirs Gumley is nothing short of atrocious!
They were notified of a water leak in the building and acknowledged the email stating it would be investigated,  several months with emails and phone calls to get nowhere and then 6 months after being told about the leak which was now just water pouring from the ceiling they send an email acting like they have just been made aware of the leak which by this point had caused severe damage to the ceiling, wall and carpet and the water was also dripping into the equipment cabinet.  They then appointment a company to carry out an investigation and get a cherry picker to access inside the roof and found someone had slit the water sealing membrane with a blade and they provided photos of this but speirs stated the repair would be at the cost of the residents.  The residents disputed the charges as this was done by someone who was a subcontractor for the developer/speirs
We were told the manager Craig Phillips would look into the matter but Craig cut all contact and ignored emails and didnt return calls and the only time we heard from them was to inform us Craig had left the position. After chasing it up again we then get told that the residents are still liable for the repair and also the repairs needed to rectify the internal damage that was made worse by speirs just ignoring the issue for 6 months

All in all Speirs Gumley are an abysmal company to deal with who lie, dont take blame for their actions and constantly talk down to their customers,  if you are unlucky enough to have them as your factors then you may best look to vote them out and appoint one you can trust",1747335870,8 months ago
PF000160,Speirs Gumley Property Management Limited,ChIJ9xXMAydEiEgRo7Xyyr5AnLM,1,Sarah Long,1,"I reported a roof leak December 31. It was end of March before it was handled and the flat could be reinstated. Problem is that it's still not fully handled. They fixed half of the roof and never investigated the other half despite their own expert leak investigator stating that it was necessary. Speirs instead sent a letter to all the owners stating that the investigator said it was fixed, when this is the opposite of what he said.

What I don't understand is why lie? I tried calling the exec director and emailing the CEO and neither returned my message. My property manager has written that she will not be calling the leak investigator. The senior leadership refuse to call me back and address the fact that a lie was knowingly sent to all the owners (it was in an email to me weeks before it was formally sent to the owners, and I promptly replied to correct it. Instead of correcting the information, they included it in the letter proving that they are spreading false information intentionally) so again, why? What is Speirs afraid of? Is this an ego thing? Do they financially benefit from denying repairs?

I've been fully available to address this, but no one has even come to the roof or met with the contractors and me! The Speirs office is 10 meters from my building yet I let the contractors in and met with them all and Speirs has been absent from the job site. Something isn't right here. It makes no sense. It's like they want to be authoritarian to the point of inaccurate yet pass the responsibility for the day-to-day to me.

Speirs, if you are reading this, something is deeply broken with your internal processes, and I am calling on you to fix this. It would start with taking an interest in my experience as your client.

Response to owner's reply: Your response did not seem tailored to the specifics of my review. I'm not talking about the contractors or the length of time, which also concerns me but less so than the communication issues.

It's quite a nice city with some ornate historical buildings, but I must admit it's getting a little tatty looking in in some places, this is only minor though, Edinburgh is still a very nice city! Something that REALLY needs sorting though is some of the roads into the city centre. They had so many pot holes, cracks and very worn out surfaces that I felt I was driving OFF ROAD!!! In fact Edinburgh has the worst roads I have seen in the UK. The council seriously need more funds to sort this.

The local buses are good, their app is also recommended to anyone visiting Edinburgh. Buses have MANY stops so a journey can take a while. Buses fill up rapidly too, so getting a seat my be difficult.

I must point out that Edinburgh has a lot of steep hills and cobbled streets, so its VERY difficult to walk around if you have a leg disability or get tired quickly. Free road trains like they have at the seafront would be good here, as they could drop people off at difficult to get to areas, like the castle entrance. Trams don't really help much in backstreets.

If you want to go into the castle you MUST book online first as you cannot buy tickets at the entrance. This is a bit silly really as not all people have the ability to use the internet. Collection points were available for tickets purchased online though.

PF000350,The City of Edinburgh Council,ChIJaRCJ94XHh0gRaSa2NyUlG28,4,DOVETAIL,1,"I write this review as I want to highlight how dangerous George IV Bridge has become for pedestrians with all the additional parking of buses and taxis especially during the recent Edinburgh Festival.
During the festival this road was used as a car park for buses and taxis and there did not seem to be any control over how many vehicles were there or where they parked. Taxis especially were parked on double yellow lines, in bus stops, beside the scaffolding at the hotel and all down Victoria Street, places where they should not be.
The roads were so busy it is a miracle no one was seriously injured as to cross the road meant taking your life in your hands.

This problem has not gone away despite the festival being over, there are now numerous single decker tour buses, Edinburgh tour buses and mini buses using it as a car park.
It is difficult to cross the road as some buses park where you should cross and also park in LRT bus stops. On Monday our bus had to double park because of tour buses and there was barely enough room to walk single file between buses to reach the pavement. An elderly lady with a Zimmer frame struggled to reach the bus and there was no room to help anyone with children and buggies.
Not only do buses park where they shouldn’t but they sit with their engines running and can also be there all day as they are just advertising for their evening excursions.
Please, please can something be done to make this street safe again for Edinburgh folk and tourists alike as this cannot go on safely long term.",1759007215,3 months ago

Until the day before of the provisional move in date, where I had to email to get an update on our move. This is where I was told that it was delayed because there was contractors in completing work.. At this point we were assured that we would get the keys the following week...
The next day, we was contacted, by email, to say that we was no longer able to move into this property due to 'unforeseen circumstances' Which later on they told us was due to not allowing pets at the property. However, this was NEVER stated in the ad, not mentioned whatsoever beforehand. In fact, we had the agreement that we would pay an extra £20 a month for our dog. Which we was fine with.
Which is why, you can understand this came as a shock to us.
At this point, we had booked a removal service, booked time off work, handed our notice into our current property and booked cleaners for our current property.
We feel we have been misled to believe we would be getting this property. Since confirming we will not be moving. The 'letting experts'/touchstone has passed across all our personal details to bill companies and the council, so we are now getting contacted constantly asking for payments and when we moved into the property.
We were excited to move into this property originally, but unfortunately we have now been under extreme stress and pressure to organise things on our side, to ensure we do not become homeless.
We feel, this whole situation has been handled in an extremely unprofessional manner and would 100% NOT recommend this business to anyone that is wanting to have a successful and smooth moving process.

Having dealt with many property management firms before, I can say that TCF stands out for their transparency, ethics, and genuine communication. There’s no sales jargon or empty promises — they explain everything clearly and always deliver on what they say.

PF000404,Wanrobe Investments Limited,ChIJ98vfhepchkgRundHJDCi97o,3,Duncan Readle,2,"An overall decent letting agency severely let down by attempts to scam us and other tenants out of deposits.

We rented with RPM for two years, and throughout that had no real issues. Most issues we brought up got passed straight to the landlord who solved them promptly, and the letting agency were fast to respond and easy to communicate with.

When we decided to move out we were warned by a friend who had rented with them recently that they would try to come for our deposit on baseless grounds - in my friends case they initially tried to take his whole deposit before backing down to a still absurd £80 each when they challenged their claims.

Sure enough, shortly after moving out we were hit with a huge list of claims relating to cleaning, repairs and even removal of items that previous tenants had left in the flat. After we challenged the claims and demanded proof, we received a set of photos covering two of the flat's four rooms and about a third of the points they raised. We again challenged them, and eventually received the photos taken in the inspection before we moved in, which were of a laughable quality and completely confirmed every point we had been making about the state of the flat when we moved in. At this point they gave up.

The degree of incompetence and either apathy or malignance that the agency handles the inspection process with is frankly astonishing. I don't have enough evidence to confidently say that they have a pattern of preying on students but it seems likely. It's regrettable that this spoiled an otherwise decent letting experience.",1662802607,3 years ago

From our very first conversation, Lauren demonstrated an unwavering dedication to achieving the best possible outcome for me. Her knowledge of the local market meant that no opportunity was missed, and I always felt confident that my property was in the best hands.

Lauren’s crafted a compelling listing, arranged professional photography, and ensured my flat was presented in its best light across all channels. Her attention to detail and knack for highlighting the property’s unique features attracted a stream of interested buyers and ultimately led to a swift and successful sale.

What set Lauren apart was her genuine warmth and approachability. She was always available for a chat, promptly answered my questions, and kept me fully informed throughout the journey.

The closing stages of the deal presented a few unexpected challenges, but Lauren’s proactive intervention made all the difference. She navigated obstacles with professionalism and resourcefulness, keeping things on track and ensuring the process moved forward smoothly.

During the rare occasions when Lauren was unavailable, Kirsty stepped in seamlessly, offering timely support and maintaining the high standard of service I had come to expect.

PF000933,West End Concept Ltd,ChIJw1caHoNFiEgRwRcjAKspL6k,4,Jackie,1,"We were a tenant with this organisation for 3 years - I’ve always had private landlords and had heard of the issues that people have with lettings agents, I thought surely it can’t be that bad?

I was wrong.

Every single issue we had whilst living at our flat was always left a ridiculously long time (roof leaks, toilet leaks etc) or a mistake would happen from their side, over complicate everything and then it would be a big mess. It actually got so bad that we ended up dealing with our landlords directly.

When we handed in our notice, we just knew there would be issues as that’s how Clyde Property operate.

They tried to change our utilities provider one month before moving out - to which I had to spend an afternoon sorting out as we were infact leaving - which confused everyone. They sent a photographer to take photos of our flat the week before we had left, so someone was trying to get into our flat whilst still there. They messed up our inspection date and were told on multiple occasions the locks were changed during our tenancy, but of course they gave the old keys to the inspector which in turn meant our inspection was done one day later whilst our landlord had sorted someone to fit a new boiler. When we did get the half done inspection, our address was completely wrong. I was so nervous about dealing with this organisation after vacating because their attention to detail and lack of communication is honestly some of the worst experiences I’ve ever had!

Fortunately, we had a very good relationship with our landlords directly and they were happy to release our deposit ASAP. Sounds like there would have been delays otherwise.

The departments lack of speaking to one another and the lack of attention to detail had been infuriating to say the least. More often than not, you’re speaking to someone who can’t be bothered to be polite enough and can’t accept their mistakes. We will never deal with this company on any capacity again, it was that bad.

I had rented out a furnished flat with Clyde Property in the West End of Glasgow. It was in prime location and was our family home.

I informed the letting agent before the rental in 2023 that I would be away for a year due to personal circumstances.

During the visit by the agent, I explained the sofa and bed had been purchased from Flexform and was expensive and explained it would need care especially as it was a coloured cream.

Clyde failed to convey the information to their regular client and he washed the sofa. It had not been dry cleaned and resulted in the fabric shrinking.

Furthermore it was then forced back on to the sofa and the ends of the fabric became torn. It also affected the shape of the sofa.

I had a management contract with Clyde and did not receive regular inventory reports. Even after highlighting the issue to them via email they failed to mention it in their inventory report.

For 3 months I have chased to get the tenant and Clyde to get the fabric replaced and sent quotations. I did not get anywhere.

Many further issues had occurred during the year where Clyde were quick to make decisions without informing myself the landlord.

I am now left with a massive repair bill on a sofa. Clyde Property's response at the moment is to make a claim on the deposit and take the client to court. In the meantime they have rented out another flat to him.

My flat is tiny so tiny when I initially viewed the property the housing officer said you can put in for a transfer to get a larger flat straight away cause we know how small it is. I learned to grow with it and never bothered as I didn't see the point. 2 years into my tenancy I am pregnant and need another property so I can actually fit my baby into the property let alone all the things a baby need and getting told I've to wait 2 years for a property when my baby is due next month .. I have letter from my doctor's and midwife stating my current property and location is having a negative affect on my health and my unborn childs which I have handed into them & they have no even looked into yet and won't be until another month apparently. I have no room to even store a pram my property is that flat and when I pointed out I only have an option to store it in the close I'm getting told I can't do that due to health and safety. My rent is completely over priced specially for the size and location (Henrietta Street) and they have a cheek to increase it every month. They don't let you know when they have arranged appointments on your behalf with city building and expect you to be in the house 24/7 despite the fact people work.

Although I have been in many other gwha properties and in many cases I have found the state of some properties to be appalling, even in some of the ""renovated"" blocks, how some of the works were signed off as complete/satisfactory is incredible.
After reading some of the other reviews, I can agree, from my own experiences, that you do feel your are dealing with a very unprofessional organisation.
When speaking with some senior staff you do get an impression that they are in their post because of time served rather than competency and I get the impression that it would be a very toxic work environment if working there.
The sense you have to ""deal with a cartel"" of arrogant liars does perfuse any interactions.
Although it must be said that I have also met some very professional, competent and friendly staff but they are few and far between.
But overall, I wouldn't rate this organisation highly. A lot of their properties are well located and poorly maintained, a lot of the staff are passed their sell by date and their is without a doubt a dishonesty and completely undeserved arrogance.
